   Basic pointer arithematic:
             Data type: int.
             Value of a: 2
             Initial address of a: 0x7ffe08ddab8c
             Incremented address of a: 0x7ffe08ddab90

             Data type: bool.
             Value of b: 1
             Initial address of b: 1
             Incremented address of b: 2

          Data type: double
          Value of c: 10.5
          Initial address of c: 0x7ffe08ddab80
          Incremented address of c: 0x7ffe08ddab88

          Data type: float.
          Value of d: 23
          Initial address of d: 0x7ffe08ddab7c
          Incremented address of d: 0x7ffe08ddab80

 Addition & Subraction using pointer:
         The difference between the values at index 4 and 2 is:20
         The addition of the values of array at index 4 and 2 is:80
